# Mapping Earthquakes
## Module 13 Data Visualization with JavaScript and APIs
---
### Overview
In this module we used Javascript, the d3 library, leaflet and Mapbox to visualize earthquake data (from the last 7 days) stored within GeoJSON files.  To best display this data we created a dynamic map with multiple map views and overlays.
